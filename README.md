# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal

For your roboCup sprints you will be setting your own goals that can be completed within a given time (usually two weeks). For our first sprint your goal will be given to you and will be completed in one week.

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

## Process

### Research

I looked up how angles and shapes (trigonometry) could help make paper structures stronger and taller. I also learned about what paper can do – how it can bend and hold up weight – to use that knowledge in my design.

### Ideation

I drew pictures to plan how to use angles and shapes in my paper tower. I thought about which angles to use and how to fold the paper to make it strong and tall.

### Prototyping

I started making a small model with paper to see if my ideas would work. I folded the paper in different ways and tested it. I changed the folds to make it better, trying to get the best balance between strength and height.

### Testing and Critique

I tested my model to make sure it could stand on its own for 30 seconds. I looked closely at what worked and what needed improvement. This helped me understand how to make my paper tower even better.

### Final design

It includes step-by-step guidelines, diagrams illustrating folding patterns, and specific measurements or angles. The design incorporates cutting as allowed, ensuring compliance with the given constraints.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the design successfully met the goal of creating the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper within the given restrictions. This project highlights the importance of creativity in paper folding and serves as a foundation for future iterations. Possible next steps could involve further refinement of folding techniques or exploring variations to enhance stability and height.
